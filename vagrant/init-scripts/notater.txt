1. Lag VMene etter instruksjoner, men aktiver NAT på alle først for å kunne installere det som trengs



Firewall rules:
Auth is an external machine:
- Can only open SSH connections and HTTP connections with the Firewall
Client is an external machine:
- Can only open SSH connections and HTTP connections with the Firewall
Firewall, eth0 192.168.0.10 to app server, eth1 192.168.1.10 to database
- All HTTP connection are redirected to App server
- Requests form the internal network 192.168.1.30, the database is only accepted if it is SSH to the app server
App server, eth0 192.168.0.20 to firewall
- Accepts HTTP connections from the external network
- Accepts SSH connections from the internal network, the database
- Does not start any new connections
database, eth0 192.168.1.30 to firewall
- Accepts ssh connections from app server
- does not start any new connections

I only want to set firewall rules on the firewall server. Please provide me with the correct firewall rule setup based on the description above. do it on this form. 
sudo iptables -t nat -F            # Flushes all the rules from table NAT
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING  -o eth2 -j MASQUERADE    # Creates a source NAT 


For auth, client, app - clone repo, install dotnet
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-5.0
